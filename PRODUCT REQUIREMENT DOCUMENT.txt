PRODUCT REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT (PRD)
SEO Operations CRM — Intelligent SEO Management & Automation System
Tech Stack: Next.js + Supabase (Auth + DB)
1️⃣ Purpose / Why This System Exists

You run many SEO projects with a small team.
There is no visibility, no task priority logic, no automated reporting, and no way to keep track of ranking, content, backlinks, or technical issues across all websites.

This CRM solves your biggest problems:

Core Problems

Too many projects — impossible to manage manually.

Small team — hard to assign work based on skill and priority.

No automated auditing — everything requires manual checks.

No ranking / content / technical monitoring per page & per location.

No structured daily / weekly workflow reporting.

No central system to assign tasks intelligently.

No clear hierarchy — different team roles need different dashboards.

No automation for repeated work like:

content audits

backlink checks

ranking updates

technical reports

page fixes

This CRM removes manual effort, human dependency, and confusion across the entire SEO process.
