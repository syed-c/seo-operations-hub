4️⃣ Core UI Components (High Fidelity)

All components must follow the rounded, soft, glassy, modern look of your sample.

Component 1 — Summary KPI Cards

Component 4 — Data Cards with Tabs

Examples from your screenshots:

Your sample sidebar uses:

minimalist icons

rounded icons with highlights

We follow exactly that style.

editing audits

Panels should be:

glass-morphism style

5️⃣ Dashboard Layout (Based on Your Reference)

User avatars

KPIs row (Clicks, Impressions, Ranking, Technical Score)

Middle Section

Two cards side-by-side:

Left card:

Ranking & Traffic charts

Filters

Backlink summary

Local SEO signals

Bottom Section

Two sections:

“Apply all” / “Create tasks” buttons

This matches your sample’s layout EXACTLY but with SEO content instead of revenue statistics.

cards are slightly lighter (#1A1C21)

graphs invert colors

shadows become softer and more diffused

Animations:

smooth fade for theme transitions (150ms ease-in-out)
